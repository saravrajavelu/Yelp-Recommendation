# Yelp Me Choose!


We provide personalized restaurant recommendations to users based on their activity on Yelp. For this, we use past reviews and ratings for a user as well as reviews/ratings from other users with similar tastes. Weâ€™re not only able to provide recommendations but also what these restaurants are known for.
